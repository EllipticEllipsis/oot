Introduction to decomp
- What we are doing
- Structure of the code

Pre-decompilation
- Building the repo (read the document)
- Reference for how we use git and github in this project (forks, git commands, pull requests)
- Using e.g. VSCode (watch Fig's video after this)
- Choosing a first actor

Decompilation
- Data, migration and non-migration
- Fake symbols

- Init and the actor struct
	- Initchains
	- Actors and dynapoly actors
	- Colliders
	- Skelanime

- The rest of the actor
    - Order of decompilation
    - Action Functions and other functions

- Matching
	- Using diff
	- control flow (branches) -> instruction ordering -> register allocation -> stack
	- The permuter
	- Appendix: Some notes on the basic structure of N64 MIPS

- Action Functions

- Draw functions

After Decompilation
- More git
- Deleting the assembly
- Format script
- Pull requests
