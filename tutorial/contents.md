# Getting started

## Introduction to decomp
- What we are doing
- Structure of the code

## Pre-decompilation
- Building the repo (read the document)
- Reference for how we use git and github in this project (forks, git commands, pull requests)
- Using e.g. VSCode (watch Fig's video after this)
- Choosing a first actor

## Decompilation

- [Begining decompolation: order, Init and the actor struct](beginning_decomp.md)
	- order of decompilation
	- Init and common actor features
		- Initchains
		- Actors and dynapoly actors
		- Colliders
		- Skelanime
	
	- Matching
		- Using diff
		- control flow (branches) -> instruction ordering -> register allocation -> stack

- [The rest of the actor](other_functions.md)
    - Order of decompilation
    - Action Functions and other functions

	- The permuter

- [Draw functions](draw_functions.md)

- Data, migration and non-migration
	- Fake symbols



## After Decompilation
- More git
- Deleting the assembly
- Format script
- Pull requests

## Apendices
- Appendix: Some notes on the basic structure of N64 MIPS
Appendix: Glossary
Appendix: Conventions
